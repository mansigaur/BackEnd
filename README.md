# BackEnd
This is a project about solving a small part of finding fake news. 
This part of the project consists of the backend, where the data was collected about the authior and their related news channel cleaned and tied up together and stored in a database for further processing. 
The data is majorly collected from BBC News Channel and their renowned authors and their subsequent channels.
The articles that are parsed and whose data is used are from 2015-2022 and so are the authors.
